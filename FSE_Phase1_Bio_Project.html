        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Im Melissa, a dedicated IT professional and people leader who loves turning innovative ideas into action. Outside of work, I express my creativity through drawing, painting, and cooking, all while enjoying the sounds of my record player. I lead an active lifestyle, training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), mountain biking, skiing, and riding motocross. I’m also passionate about mental health awareness and enjoy discussing the realities of being a working mom while living with ADHD. With a blend of creativity and compassion, I’m committed to personal growth and supporting others on their journeys.</p>
